# 🧑🏻‍💻 Chandler Barnes ♿

CTO and full‑stack engineer shipping AI and creator‑economy tools. I lead teams, bend cloud costs, and turn messy ideas into lovable software.

> Building useful things, learning fast, and keeping the humans in the loop.

### What I’m focused on right now 🎯

* ⚖️ **Stealth AI Startup**: an AI‑powered firm for founders and investors. Slack‑first assistant, human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, and productized services.
* 📈 **RootNote**: creator analytics infrastructure at scale. Data ingestion pipelines, dashboards, alerts, and cost‑efficient infra.
* 🔎 **RAG you can trust**: pgvector + Supabase, source‑grounded answers, evaluation harnesses, and strict fallback to humans when confidence is low.
* 🤖 **Agentic workflows**: Slack bots that can reason about tools, route to humans when needed, and leave an audit trail.

### Recent projects 🛠️

* 📬 **Address Parse API**: production API that parses messy addresses into structured components.
* 🎯 **Procrastination Popper**: breaks intimidating tasks into tight, rewarding loops.
* 🔔 **ESP32 Gameshow Buzzers**: wireless buzzers with lights, sound, and score tracking.
* 🎂 **Birthday Tools**: quick‑add birthdays to Google Calendar with optional half‑birthdays and enumerated years.

> Repos are public when possible. Some projects live in private monorepos due to customer data or licensing.

### Engineering principles 📐

* **Ship the smallest useful thing**: reduce scope, raise quality, iterate.
* **Ground answers in sources**: citations first, confidence scoring, human review when needed.
* **Make it observable**: logs, metrics, traces, and dashboards by default.
* **Design for failure**: graceful fallbacks, idempotency, retries, circuit breakers.
* **Optimize for developer joy**: clear PRD, typed APIs, fast CI, great DX.
* **Spend where it matters**: keep perf high and infra lean.

### Recent wins 🏆

* Cut infra costs by more than 90 percent with a DynamoDB query overhaul.
* Grew RootNote from zero to 50k+ creators with a tiny team.
* Built a RAG stack that prefers saying “I don’t know” over guessing.

### How I work 🧠

* Healthy skepticism of “move fast and break things.” Prefer “move focused and don’t break trust.”
* Habit of turning vague ideas into clear specs and checklists.
* Strong bias for pairing with design, legal, and operations.
* Early mornings, regular releases, and crisp commit messages.
